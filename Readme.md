# Plasma

Plasma is a library for .NET which allows you to host an ASP.NET application within another running process (like a test runner). Once running you can fire requests at the application programmatically and even change state within the application while it is running.

The upshot is that you can write very fast and painless tests on your ASP.NET application. v

# Support

It supports all .NET web applications that can be run in IIS or the web development server. It has been tested with .NET versions 3.5 and above but it shou$ld also support 2.0. If you have any problems getting your particular web application to run, please raise an issue on the GitHub issue page for this project: [http://github.com/jennifersmith/plasma/issues]
